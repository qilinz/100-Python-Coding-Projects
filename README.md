# 100 Python Coding Projects
Based on the course 100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu. Notes of the course can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/a73c7d0045944619aa08b1594cefedf4?v=8462b4251f94434784b6067fff6542d4).
### Intermediate level
- Day 15: [Coffee Machine](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Intermediate/Day15-coffee-machine/Day15-coffee-machine.py). Users can buy three kinds of coffees on a coin-operated coffee machine. The profit and the remaining resources of the machine is calculated upon orders. Requirements of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Intermediate/Day15-coffee-machine/Coffee-Machine-Program-Requirements.pdf). 
### Beginner level
- Day 14: [Higher or lower](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day14-higher-lower/Day14-higher-lower.py). Users can guess who has more followers on a platform until they give a wrong answer. The flow chart of the game can be found [here](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day14-higher-lower/higher-lower.png). (Final project for the beginner level)
- Day 13: No project. Debug exercises.
- Day 12: [Number Guessing](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day12-number-guessing.py). Users need to find the right answer with limited attempts of the chosen difficulty. (Scope, constants)
- Day 11: [Blackjack](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day11-blackjack/Day11-blackjack.py). User can play the Blackjack with the computer dealer. It's a simplified version as the cards are infinite, namely the probability of drawing a card does not change. The flow chart can be found [here](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day11-blackjack/Day11-blackjack.png). (Capstone Project of the first 10 days)  
- Day 10-2: [Calculator](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day10/Day10-calculator.py). Calculator with four operations ("+", "-", "x", "/"). Users can continue the calculation based on the obtained result, or start a new calculation. (Functions with outputs)
- Day 10-1: [Days in month](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day10/Day10-days-in-month.py). Tell users how many days in the chosen month in the chosen year. (Functions with outputs)
- Day 9: [Blind Auction](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day9-blind-auction/Day9-blind-auction.py). Users can type their names and bids. The one whose bid is the highest will win. The flow chart can be found [here](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day9-blind-auction/blind-auction-flow-chart.png). (Dictionary, loop in dictionary)
- Day 8-2: [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day8-caesar-cipher.py). Users can encode or decode Caesar Cipher messages. (Function with parameters)
- Day 8-1: [Prime Checker](https://github.com/qilinz/100-Python-Coding-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day8-prime-checker.py). Users can check whether a number is a prime number. (Function with one parameter)
- Day 7: [Hangman Game](https://github.com/qilinz/Python-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day7-hangman/Day7-hangman.py). User need to guess the right word with limited lives. The game flow chart can be found [here](https://github.com/qilinz/Python-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day7-hangman/hangman-flow-chart.png). (While loop, for loop, import statements, conditional statements)
- Day 6: [Lost in a maze](https://github.com/qilinz/Python-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day6-lost-in-a-maze.py). Solve one of the [Karel Robot Challenge](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json). Robot is located randomly in the maze and need to find the exit. (Functions, while loop)
- Day 5: [Password Generator](https://github.com/qilinz/Python-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day5-password-generator.py). A password will be generated randomly by asking users how many letters, symbols and numbers are needed. There are two letter of password, easy one and hard one. The easy one is generated using the order letters, symbols and numbers. FOr the hard one, all kinds of characters are mixed. (For loop)
- Day 4: [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/qilinz/Python-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day4-rock-paper-scissors.py). Users can play the game with the computer. (Randomisation, list) 
- Day 3: [Treasure Island](https://github.com/qilinz/Python-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day3-treasure-island.py). Users will win if choose all choices correctly. (Conditional statements)
- Day 2: [Tip Calculator](https://github.com/qilinz/Python-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day2-tip-calculator.py). Calculate the split bill for users. (Data type conversion, f-string)
- Day 1: [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/qilinz/Python-Projects/blob/main/Beginner/Day1-band-name-generator.py). Combine user's inputs of city and pet name as the brand name.
